This implements a timer class that supports pausing and resuming measurements with a clock precision template parameter (i.e. milliseconds, seconds, minutes, etc.).

The timer.png file contains a screenshot of the timer operation test. Also, the result of the timer operation is written in text form in the output.txt file.

4) STL containers fall into three main categories: sequential, associative, and adapters.
Starting with C++11, the STL contains 6 sequence containers:
   std::vector;
   std::deque;
   std::array;
   std::list;
   std::forward_list;
   std::basic_string.
Associative containers:
   set;
   multiset;
   map;
   multimap.
Adapters:
   stack;
   queue;
   priority_queue.

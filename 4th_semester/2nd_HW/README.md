1) Time comparison:
The time_comp.cpp file provides code to calculate the time of sorting a set of random numbers for six data structures (array, vector, deque, list and forward_list). The result is presented in the output.txt file. The winner was std::array.

2)Phone Book: A container for storing a telephone directory has been developed, which provides:
     Access to records sorted by person's last name (for city printing).
